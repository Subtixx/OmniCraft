The wrench is a versatile tool for manipulating vanilla, modded and Omnicraft Blocks.

Currently, the wrench can be used to rotate blocks, and in the future, it will be used for more advanced block manipulation.

## Rotating Blocks

<Image src={WrenchAnimated} alt="Rotating Blocks" 
    style="width: 100%; max-width: 200px; float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;" />

To rotate a block, simply right-click on the block with the wrench in hand.
The block will rotate 90 degrees clockwise with each right-click.
If a block has any kind of interaction, such as opening a GUI, it is necessary to sneak-right-click to rotate the block.

### Multi-Rotation

If a block can be rotated in more than one direction (e.g. a log block), 
clicking on different sides of the block will rotate it in different directions.
