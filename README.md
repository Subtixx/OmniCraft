# Why the name?

I don't know. Just wanted to create a mod to consolidate different mods. Why the duck do we need 20+ mods with each having only 1 item???? Thats stupid.

# What is it?

It currently contains only 1 item, forked from [Mrbysco](https://github.com/Mrbysco/Measurements) but converted to kotlin, uses NeoForge instead of Forge + some additions I think it was missing.

- It renders a full wireframe instead of just the edges.
- It does not care about being obstructed. It never occludes
- Max limit is 64 active regions (arbitrary limit, just to keep it a sane number.)
- Switching away from the tape measure doesn't clear its history, only SHIFT + Right Click undos the last region.
- It uses different colors (+1 every new region :))
- It has an overlay to show the stats of the currently highlighted region.
- It also measures diag distance
